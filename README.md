Hello My Dear Githubian Friends.
I'm Abtin and i'm half software engineer. (i'm still at college)
This is my very first project as a developer.
It is a windows form app for managing fastfood which is in persian which can use just in iran. But in the future i will try to design it in english so that other people in the world can use it.
I've forgot to say that this is basic project or undone project ( i mean you can use it but not for a big restaurent with even online orders).
In the future i will add more option to it for example i will build database for it by using "sql server" so that it can use to manage big restaurants and use for online orders.
